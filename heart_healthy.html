    <h2>Food for the Heart</h2> 
    

    <p>Diet along with exercise is an essential part of maintaining good cardiovascular health. As much of the public is uninformed on the benefits of nutritious foods on decreasing cardiovascular disease risk, we aim to provide research based dietary solutions.</p>
    <p>It is often emphasized that whole grains such as brown rice, oats, quinoa etc. are preferred over processed grains such as white rice, pasta, breads etc. This is because whole grains provide a balance of vitamins and minerals that are essential for optimal heart and body function. Whole grains also help because they have a low glycemic index (GI), meaning they are slowly absorbed into our blood. This helps us keep a steady insulin release from the pancreas instead of irregular spikes, which contributes to better cardiovascular health.<br> </p>
    <p>People usually carry a misconception that fats are terrible for cardiovascular health. While saturated fats and trans-fats are indeed bad for coronary artery disease in the long-term, good fats, such as monounsaturated fats and omega 3’s are wonderful additions to our diet. Saturated fats are those that remain solid at room temperature, such as meat fats, coconut oil, dark meats etc. Trans-fats is found in processed foods, such as fast foods, margarine, cakes, cookies etc. It is important to cut these down to prevent heart disease. Instead, we should opt for healthy fats, such as avocados, fish oil, nuts, and other natural foods. With protein, we should focus on plant-based proteins and moderate amounts of 
    and fish, instead of constantly eating red meats such as beef and pork. Changing all these habits raises our “good cholesterol” (HDL) and reduces “bad cholesterol” (LDL).<br></p> 
    <p>Inflammation is also a key risk factor of cardiovascular disease. Stress and poor diet can lead to inflammation in our whole bodies, which over the long-term, leads to artery disease. To reduce our inflammation, antioxidants are essential in our diet. Eating antioxidant rich foods such as berries, whole foods, colored foods, nuts etc. reduces inflammation and improves our overall heart health. Antioxidants also protect our blood vessels from stiffening or aging and keep our cardiovascular system youthful. It is therefore important to eat these foods for heart health and reducing our risk of coronary artery disease.</p>
    <p>Besides heart diseases, we should always try to maintain healthy blood pressure. This means that we must reduce our overall sodium intake. Sodium is found in nearly all foods and is essential to our diet, but too much can actually increase our risk for high blood pressure or hypertension. Western diet and fast foods increase our risk for eating too much sodium and not enough potassium, which leads to high blood pressure. To maintain health blood pressure of 120/80, it is important to reduce sodium to preferred levels of 2300 mg/day and eat more potassium rich foods like fruits, vegetables and leafy greens. We should also regularly check our blood pressure and visit the doctor for our checkups. As always, moderation is key to our diet and heart health.</p>
